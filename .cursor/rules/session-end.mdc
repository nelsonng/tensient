# Session End Protocol

Before ending any coding session, update these promptfood/ files:

1. **journal.md** -- Add an entry for what was built this session
2. **current_state.md** -- Update if deployment state, URLs, or features changed
3. **decisions.md** -- Add an ADR if any architectural decisions were made
4. **technical_debt.md** -- Add new debt items or mark resolved ones
5. **BOOTSTRAP.md** -- Update reading order if new files were added

This ensures the next AI agent session starts with full situational awareness.

Do NOT skip this. Stale docs mislead future sessions.
